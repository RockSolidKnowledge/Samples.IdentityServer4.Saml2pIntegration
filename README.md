# Sample projects implementing Rsk SAML component

SAML2P service provider and identity provider implementations. We support various IdentityServer implementations, including IdentityServer4 and Duende IdentityServer. 

The SAML2P component is available from [www.identityserver.com/products/saml2p](https://www.identityserver.com/products/saml2p).

The [master](https://github.com/RockSolidKnowledge/Samples.IdentityServer4.Saml2pIntegration/tree/master) branch currently uses IdentityServer4 v4 and Duende IdentityServer. Check out [identityserver4-v3](https://github.com/RockSolidKnowledge/Samples.IdentityServer4.Saml2pIntegration/tree/identityserver4-v3) for IdentityServer4 v3 samples.
